# Apex HTTP Server

A high-performance, production-grade HTTP/1.1 server built from scratch in C++ using Linux system calls.

> ⚠️ **Status:** Active Development  
> This project is being built incrementally. Check the [Development Roadmap](#roadmap) for current progress.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

Build a professional HTTP server that demonstrates:
- Deep understanding of network programming and TCP/IP
- Modern C++ development practices
- Linux system internals (epoll, threading, signals)
- Production-grade observability and reliability
- Performance optimization and benchmarking

**This is not a framework wrapper — every line is written from scratch.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar)
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ (C++17 support)
- Make
- OpenSSL (for TLS support, optional)

### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/apex-http-server.git
cd apex-http-server
make
```

### Run
```bash
./bin/apex-server --config config/server.conf
```

Default server runs on `http://localhost:8080`

### Test
```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Or use your browser
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Example `config/server.conf`:
```ini
[server]
port = 8080
host = 0.0.0.0
threads = 4
max_connections = 1000

[paths]
document_root = ./www
log_file = ./logs/server.log

[performance]
keep_alive_timeout = 60
request_timeout = 30
```

---

## 📊 Performance

*Benchmarks will be added as development progresses*

Target performance:
- 50,000+ requests/sec on modern hardware
- < 1ms median latency for static files
- Support 10,000+ concurrent connections

---

## 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run integration tests
make integration-test

# Load testing
make benchmark
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Build Options
```bash
make              # Build release version
make debug        # Build with debug symbols
